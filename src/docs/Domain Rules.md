Domain Rules (Simple)
	•	Every subject (Math, English, Kannada, Human Body, etc.) has a bank of questions/words, grouped by complexity levels (Level 1 = easiest, Level 2 = harder, and so on).
	•	Kids practice in sets of up to 12 tiles at a time.
		• Each question tracks progress with a step counter (0, 1, 2...):
		• Correct → move up 1 step (max 5, but mastery at step 2).
		• Wrong → move down 1 step (not below 0).
		• Step 2 = Mastered (not 5).
		• Mastered questions enter a cooldown/revision cycle before being removed from active practice.
		• If fewer than 12 unmastered questions remain in the current level, the app simply shows that smaller number.
		• Progression: Once all questions in the current level are mastered (step ≥ 2), the app automatically moves to the next level.
		• When all levels are mastered, the child sees “You’ve finished all questions!”

Example: Math Mode (15 in Level 1, 20 in Level 2)
	 1.  Start → child sees 12 unmastered words from Level 1.
	 2.  Child masters them all (step ≥ 2).
	 3.  Next set → app shows the 3 remaining unmastered words (not padded to 12).
	 4.  Once those 3 are mastered → Level 1 is complete.
	 5.  The app automatically moves to Level 2.
	 6.  Child now sees 12 unmastered words from Level 2, and so on until all 20 are mastered.
	 7.  If no more levels exist → show completion message.
