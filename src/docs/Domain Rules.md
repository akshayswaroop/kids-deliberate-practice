Domain Rules (Simple)
	•	Every subject (Math, English, Kannada, Human Body, etc.) has a bank of questions/words, grouped by complexity level (Level 1 = easiest, then Level 2, etc.).
	•	Kids practice in sets of 12 tiles at a time.
	•	Correct answer → progress forward (+20%).
	•	Wrong answer → progress backward (−20%, not below 0).
	•	A question is mastered at 100% and removed from active practice.
	•	A session always shows 12 tiles:
	•	If fewer than 12 unmastered questions remain in the current level, the rest are filled with mastered ones (clearly marked).
	•	Progression: Once all questions in the current level are mastered, the app automatically moves to the next level.
	•	When all levels are mastered, the child sees a clear “You’ve finished all questions!” message.

Example: Math Mode with 15 in Level 1, 20 in Level 2
	1.	Start → 12 unmastered words from Level 1 are shown.
	2.	Child masters them all.
	3.	Next set → 3 remaining unmastered words + 9 mastered fillers.
	4.	Once those 3 are mastered → Level 1 is complete.
	5.	The app automatically moves to Level 2.
	6.	Child now sees a set of 12 unmastered words from Level 2.
	7.	This continues until all 20 are mastered, then the app either moves to Level 3 (if available) or shows completion message.
