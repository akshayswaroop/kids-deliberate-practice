We want to cotinue show the question like now however we do not want to show 12 questions as rectangles or bubbles which get filled with rainbow as some people thought they are options to the questions. Instead of that why don't we show an actual rainbow which gets coloured with gradient as mastery level is achieved so imaginign a colourless rainbow which gets 50% filled with one correct answer and complete with mastery etc.
