# Agent Instructions: Docs Priority

This repository contains important design and domain knowledge in `src/docs`. Automated agents and scripts should treat files in that folder as authoritative when making decisions, changes, or generating new code.

Key points:

- Primary docs folder: `src/docs`
- Important files: `architecture.md`, `Domain Rules.md`
- Agents should read these files before proposing or applying changes that affect system behavior, architecture, or domain logic.
- When in conflict, prefer guidance from these docs over comments in code or other ad-hoc notes.

Minimal and intentionally terse â€” keep this file at the repository root to be easy to find by automation and humans.
